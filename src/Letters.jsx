            text: "Jessie, The holidays are a time meant for loved ones to be together and to appreciate one another. While we both were surrounded by our loved ones and family members, we were apart. Obviously we weren't able to see each other, but we were in each other's thoughts all the time. The amount of times I missed you and didn't say anything are too many to count. I know you're receiving this gift after the holidays, I would've liked to have given this to you on time but obviously I couldn't lol. This year has brought and taught me a lot of things, some good, some bad. But the best thing that's happened to me started on the 25th of September at 7:20 pm. That's when the most beautiful woman I'd ever seen appeared in front of me. And on December 7th you made my dream of making you my girlfriend a reality. Without a doubt it was the best moment of my year because it made me so happy and it showed me that you shared the same feelings I did. Hearing you say those three words for the first time made me feel something I'd never felt before. I love you so much and I'm grateful to have you in my life. This gift is not only as a kind gesture for the holidays but as a sign of my love for you. While it’s something off your list, I bought it with your spirit in mind. I hope this is our first of many holidays together. I love you, Martin",

            text: "In the 20 years I've had of life I've never known what it means to be loved by someone, nor what it means to love someone outside of my family. I always felt bad about myself, never having had someone I could call a partner and seeing all my friends having had at least a few. I thought I was going to be single for a little longer. Thoughts flooded my mind about never being enough for someone and the lonely Saturday nights sometimes had small tears running down my face. Then I met the most beautiful woman I'd ever laid eyes on. From the moment I laid eyes on you and we started talking, I knew there was a genuine connection being formed. The chemistry we had was almost natural, as if we'd known each other for years. I was getting excited as I thought I finally had the opportunity I'd been waiting for. It seemed like someone was happy to be something other than just a friend. As I was talking to this girl, I could see that a spark was forming. We cared for each other, supported each other, and laughed with each other. She was making me feel so special, and it was clear that I was making her feel special. We understood each other. We made each other feel happy. We lended each other a hand when we were both at our lowest points.There were some rough patches where I found out that I had a lot to learn and some moments occurred which shed a lot of light on both this girl and myself and what I wanted. I found out things about myself that I didn't know about, like how soft I can be. I also learned things like how to approach a sensitive situation and how to show affection the right way. But these things only made our connection stronger. It showed us that we were willing to fight for something bigger. We wanted to help each other grow, in spite of the difficulties ahead. I started getting feelings for this girl. As she did for me. I didn't know at the time but she was always thinking about me, as I was always thinking about her. Texts turned into calls, calls turned into seeing each other in person. Every time I saw her I got butterflies because I couldn't contain my emotions about how I truly felt.  At first I thought it was just a normal crush, but it felt like it was more than just a crush. I was falling in love. I'd never felt it before and it felt so nice. I prayed that the feeling was mutual and I wasn't being irrational or moving too fast. It wasn't until she confessed her feelings to me that I was able to relax. The day she confessed was one of the happiest days of my life. It showed me that all the work I'd been putting into myself had paid off. I internally celebrated, praying that I didn't make any wrong moves and messed up my chances. There was still work to be done on myself, but I knew what the end goal was, I just had to stay focused and be composed. That leads us to the present. We sit together here today as boyfriend and girlfriend. I love this woman that’s sat in front of me with all of my heart and I know she does too. I see her as my Roman empire. Not a second goes by without her presence in my mind. I care for her like I've never cared for anyone before. I've never felt this way about someone and it makes me so happy. Everything about her, her beautiful face, her glistening smile, her glowing personality, her shining eyes, her peaceful voice, her stunning body. I love everything about her. She fills me with so much peace and happiness that sometimes I don’t know what to do. The day we sealed the deal and became boyfriend and girlfriend, and by extension this date, was one of the most important and happiest days of my life because I knew that I won. I won over the woman of my dreams and we can begin to make happy memories together. Having confirmed the relationship before winter break might’ve been one of the best decisions we could’ve made. They say distance makes the heart grow farther. I found that to be the truth. Not a moment passed without you in my thoughts, making me fall deeper in love and more obsessed than the day before. It was hard, but knowing that sooner or later I was going to see your cute and beautiful smile again made the wait worth it. They say distance makes the heart grow fonder. I think that’s true because over break not a second went by without you being in my thoughts. I couldn't get your beautiful little smile out of my head. I love how obsessed with you I’ve become in a relatively short time. The distance between us may physically separate us, but the love I have for you will never emotionally, nor spiritually, make me go away. Your cuteness has such a special place in my heart, I can’t Your soothing presence, the way you comfort and support me when I need it, the way we both think and have similar opinions, the way you inspire me to do better and improve myself, the way you work on yourself, always pushing yourself to be the best. All of it makes me love you. You’re the yin to my yang with the way we complement each other’s flaws, picking each other up and supporting each other. You bring color into my otherwise black and white life. You make me the happiest man in the world and I hope to make you the happiest woman in the world. And I hope by reading this that you understand how deeply I love you and how much I want to share the future together. Who knows where life will take us, but I want to spend it with you. Jessie Jiang, I love youWith much love, Martin❤️",

Even though we weren't together the whole time because of break and school, every moment we've been together has filled me with so much happiness and peace. Moments with you give me so much purpose. You give me so much purpose. It doesn't matter if it's going out to stores, laying in bed all day, going on a walk, or going to the library, every moment with you holds a special place in my heart. While still young, our love is something so pure and beautiful, and it's something that should last for a long time. I love you so much and you deserve to be appreciated. With that said, it's a little overdue but Jessie Jiang, will you be my valentine?With love, Martin",

Being able to have that dinner with you, spend weekends with you, go home with you, go on walks, and laugh together makes every second with you worth living. January 24th, while not our anniversary or a special holiday, lives on in my head as it’s the day that I was able to show how much I loved you. Seeing you cry when you read the letter I wrote genuinely became a core memory and I saw it as a sign that what we have isn’t just some generic love, it’s something that has real attachment and meaning behind it. While Valentine’s Day is meant to be more reciprocant, I want to make you feel even more loved than that night. I want our first Valentine’s together to remain in both our hearts for a long time. Being able to love you is one of God’s greatest gifts to me. Making you feel loved, comfortable, safe, and most importantly, valued is some of my favorite things to do with you. You’re my beautiful girlfriend and I want you to know how much you mean to me. I love you so much, Happy Valentine’s Day my love, Martin",

From everything that happened with simba to deciding to go into finance, none of it gets close to my favorite moment - meeting you. From the moment I started texting you, I knew something good was going to come out of it. Every time we texted, every time we spoke on the phone, and when we started dating, every time we saw each other and stayed at each other’s done made me so happy. The past 5 months since we started dating has made this easily one of the happiest periods of my life. You fill me with so much purpose and drive that I didn’t have before and I will forever be grateful for you changing my way of thinking. Being apart from you this summer is going to be so hard, but I know that we’ll come out on the other side of it so happy to finally see and be with each other after 3 months apart, especially now with you in Tampa. They say distance makes the heart grow fonder. It’ll be challenging, but I know we can tough it out, especially with the occasional visit in the summer to each other. I just want to say thank you for being a part of my life and for loving me and for making these past months some of the happiest and most memorable of my life; from going to sweet buns to having our date and dressing up for your banquet, I love every second of it. I can’t wait for what the future brings us and what our plans bring for the semesters and years to come. I love you, I’ll miss you, Martin",

In my 21 years of life on this Earth I’ve had a lot of different people teach me a lot of different things: soccer, cooking, math, programming and all of that stuff. But nobody had ever taught me how to love properly… until I met you. The past 7 months have been some of the happiest of my life and it all comes down to the way you let me love you. Yes I’ve been told to open doors, not walk ahead but beside, be nice and all that, but never how to make the love feel known. You have helped me realize how to do all of these different acts of kindness that make your life just a little bit easier and that in turn, makes us happier. Ultimately, I think it was God’s plan that let all this happen. He made you appear in a moment that was life changing for the both of us; you were deciding between accounting and data analytics, and I was struggling with CS, but he knew to put us together because he knew that we would both help each other and find our way. You have helped me grow so much not only as a student or as a boyfriend, but as a human being on this planet. The memories we’ve made together and some of the happiest times of my life and I wouldn’t trade it for anything else in the world. You make me so happy that you have no idea how important you are to me. You fill me with so much motivation to be the best version of myself at all times, and I sincerely thank you for all that you have given me. You are my inspiration and the brightest star in the night sky for me. I hope you have an amazing 20th birthday my love! I love you so much, Martin",

            text: "Hi baby, It's been a while since I wrote you a note. Ever since the semester started, it’s been so fun and amazing having you so close by. All the times we’ve gone to lunch, studied together, driven each other, and made plans for the weekend have made my semester so much easier to handle. That said, I’m so proud of you for how you’re handling things so far this semester. You’ve been so busy and despite all the work, you never stop working to be the best possible version of you. That’s why I love you! I love knowing that you’ll never stop to achieve what makes you happy. Our happiness is linked together and I’m so glad that we’ve both been working on ourselves to have the best possible future come graduation. Despite your successes, I know things are rough. I will always be your #1 supporter and no matter what happens, I will always be right by your side to be the first person to help you get back on your feet. In our relationship, one of the most important things for me is our communication. Despite all of the good times we’ve had this semester, we’ve both noticed that sometimes a stray comment comes out that harms the other. I’m so proud of both of us for talking to each other about these things and always being open with each other on how to improve. We both want each other to live a happy life together and start a family, and the only way we can achieve that is through communicating with each other. I love you for listening and keeping your heart open to my words.I’m writing this the night I asked you if I’m the one for you. Your answer wasn’t expected, to be honest, and I know it hasn’t been a full year yet so I understand but I still felt a little down. You mentioned how it doesn’t feel like we’re “chasing each other” and I completely get it. Despite both of us being busy, I noticed that I haven’t been super creative recently. Hanging out is getting too repetitive like you said; Me going over to yours, you doing a quiz, maybe getting dinner, going to bed. I realized that I need to reignite the spark that had us deeply in love with each other many months ago. After my family, you are the most important person in the world to me. You are more than just my girlfriend, you’re my best friend, someone that I want to spend the rest of my life with God willing, start a wonderful and happy family with you. I’m always listening to you and I’m always growing and being the best boyfriend I can be, one that’s fitting to receive your love and affection. I’ve learned so much with you, and there’s still so much more there is to learn as we grow through life. We’ve learned so much about each other and I don’t want that to stop. I know this note isn’t super lovey dovey, but more a reflection of what’s been going on. I’m not gonna lie, having deep conversations is sometimes scary because I don’t know what you’re gonna say because I’m so self conscious of what you think of me, and of yourself. I’m really scared to live a life without you, seeing how much you’ve made me into a better person in such a short amount of time. Sometimes hearing things you say about yourself, like the other day about you know what, it got me really scared and worried for you, but at the end I was happy because I was able to offer you support, and you crying in my arms felt like I was helping you release so many emotions at once. I guess what I wanted to say with this note was that I will strive to do everything in my power to make you happy for as long as possible in this relationship. I feel like every time there’s even a minor touch of conflict or sadness or something between us, I always end up getting super reflective and wondering what went wrong. Tears fill my eyes and drop down my face many nights because I think about spending the rest of my life with you. I love you so much, and I will never stop giving you my all. You mean the world and more to me and your heart has filled me with so much passion for your spirit. You are my love. I’ll never stop fighting for you. Our kids will learn that, in time. I love you, Te amo, 我爱你, Martin",

First of all, I just wanted to say that I'm so incredibly proud of you for all the work you've done this semester to achieve your goals. It was by far the hardest semester I've seen you go through as you're president of AS and Finance VP for DSP, not to mention your classes and everything in between. You're such an inspiration not just to me but to others. The dedication you put to your work sets you apart from everyone and it's that hard work and dedication that got you a spot at PWC. Despite all the struggles and the urge to quit, I couldn't be more proud to be by your side the whole way, and I'm so happy for you. You made this happen, not anybody else. The things you do rub off onto everyone, including me. Ever since RJ, I've been a little upset at myself, but I have to learn from it. Every morning I ask God not only for the strength, wisdom, focus, and discipline to continue improving everyday, but also for our relationship to be kept strong under his watch. We compliment each other perfectly - overwhelmed and reassuring, hyper (lol) and relaxed, king and queen. You make it so easy to be with you because you bring out parts of me I never knew existed. I never thought that I would've ever had a relationship with a stuffed animal like I do with baby lol. I think it definitely has to do with your heart and how you're just so gentle and kind. Your kindness and nature make me love doing things for you and making your life easier one act of kindness at a time. You have the purest soul I've ever crossed with, and I love the compassion you have for those around you. You say how you get upset sometimes that in your relationships, people often take from you more than that give. Nothing would make me happier than to give you more than I would ever care to receive. After all, it's my job to be the provider lol. Absolutely nothing on this planet would make me happier than to give you the world, because you are my world. You're the fire that keeps on burning in my heart and the light at the end of the tunnel. I don't know what I would be without you, but with you, I can tell you that I've become a better man than I would've ever dreamed of. May God protect the fire burning in our hearts for each other and I pray that he protects you and our future family from all the evil out there. I love you so much, and I'll never stop loving you.

That was the single best decision I’ve ever had in my life and I’ve never looked back. All the memories, laughs, trips, tears, smiles, struggles, stories, and experiences that we’ve shared has made this undoubtedly the best year of my life, and I’m so glad it was you that I could share all that with. The little boy you have as my contact pic would be so proud of who he gets to share a life with. I’m sure the little girl in your past would say the same. We’ve both grown so much in the past year, with you finally getting your dream internship with PWC to me finding that spark with programming again and to getting my first internship. My growth is nowhere near finished but I know that with you by my side it can make all the struggle so much easier to deal with. Letting you be the fuel that drives my dreams is what can make those dreams become reality. My dream is to work a successful job that can allow me to support our future family where our kids are worry free and where you can be the queen you deserve to be. 3 ½ years ago I walked into college with no experiences, relatively poor social skills, dead fits, and strange interests and over time, my friends and those around me shaped me into who I am today. Of everyone I spent time with, you have been the single greatest influence of them all. You allowed me to get out of my shell, not just professionally but socially. That has been one of the greatest gifts you have given me. The ability to finally be able to speak for myself in a room full of others will forever tie me to you and I’m glad that God put you in my path. You know that book I have of prayers that I read every day? Today’s entry is titled “Indescribable gift”. I think you are God’s indescribable gift to me. Every single moment we’ve shared has allowed me to become who I am today. You’ve provided so much to me that it’s never enough to just say thank you. I’m forever thankful to God for letting such a gift surround my soul and bless me with the energy you radiate. Jessie, you are the kindest, smartest, cutest, purest, nicest, sincerest, devoted, sweetest, and most beautiful being that this planet has to offer. Our union this past year has shown me that you are the most important being in the world to me. Everything I do is for your comfort and safety. Thank you for allowing this 2025 to be the best year of my life. If I am to ask God for one thing right now, it would be to ask for your safety and success by my side. Nobody knows what the future holds, but it’s my hope that God will bless our special relationship and grant us many years even better than this one. Hopefully our kids can one day read this letter and learn just how much their mom means to me. I love you so much baby, Happy Anniversary! - Martin ♥",
